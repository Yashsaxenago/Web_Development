        <h2>Work Experience </h2>
        <h4>Software Developer , KPIT</h4>
        <p>Currently, I am about to finish college. In the course of these few years during postgraduation, we have been taught a lot of things. But the practical application of my knowledge will help me know how much have I learned. Since I am a fresher, I am still learning. But I can vouch for the fact that I am a fast learner. I am always open to learning and unlearning at the same time. Unlearning as in letting go of outdated practices and ideas and moving on to more advanced procedures. Joining your firm will gauge where I stand. No better opportunity than this can come my way. I can showcase my talent and prove my skills here, while in turn, I can learn how this industry functions in and out. That is why you may hire me for this internship.
